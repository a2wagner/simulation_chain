Simulation Chain
================

These are the scripts which I use to simulate events. Further programs used are the Pluto event generator and the Geant4 simulation code from the A2.

The scripts will run interactive, the only thing is to adapt the paths where the data should be stored as well as where the needed packages like a2geant, AcquRoot and a2GoAT are located and start everything via `./run.py`.

New channels can be added very easy using the same nomenclature for the decays as found in the scripts. By simply commenting the lines belonging to certain channels at the beginning of the `run.py` their terminal prompt will be skipped.


Prerequisites
-------------

The following programs have to be installed and set up properly:

- [ROOT framework](http://root.cern.ch/ "ROOT")
- [Pluto event generator](http://www-hades.gsi.de/?q=pluto "Pluto")
- For the detector simulation:
	- [Geant4](http://geant4.cern.ch/ "Geant4")
	- [A2 Geant4 package](https://github.com/A2-Collaboration/a2geant "A2 package")
- If the particle reconstruction should be done, the following programs are needed as well:
	- [AcquRoot](https://github.com/A2-Collaboration-dev/acqu "acqu")
	- [a2GoAT](https://github.com/A2-Collaboration-dev/a2GoAT "a2GoAT")

In order to run the detector simulation with Geant4, the file `vis.mac` has to be placed in the macros folder where the A2 Geant4 package had been installed.

Converting the files generated with Pluto to use them within Geant4, the pluto2mkin converter, written by Dominik Werthm√ºller, is needed. It should be located in the A2 Geant directory.

If you want the particle reconstruction to be done, make sure you use the TA2GoAT class as your physics class as well as provide a finish macro (line `Finish: ...` in the analysis config file) which terminates AcquRoot like the `FinishMacro.C` provided with this repository.


###Path changes in the scripts

Some paths must be changed according to the output directories where the data should be stored as well as where the A2 Geant package is located. In the beginning of the file `run.py` there are all paths in capital letters marked which has to be changed in order to run the automated simulation chain.

Besides this Python script the Geant4 macro `vis.mac` inside the macros folder of the A2 package must be replaced by the one from this repository. In the file `vis.mac` the only not commented line `/control/execute macros/g4run_multi.mac` should work without changing anything when the a2geant package is installed without modifications.

By default the Pluto generated data will be stored in the directory sim_data and the detector simulated data will be stored in g4_sim. The folder g4run contains the per channel information for the particles to be tracked within Geant4. The tracking information can easily be accessed by running the `pluto2mkin` converter which displays the needed information. The AcquRoot output will be stored in acqu, GoAT files in goat and the merged files to access the generated and simulated information within your own GoAT class will me stored in merged. You can provide a config file with all the channels which should be simulated like the example `channel_config`.
